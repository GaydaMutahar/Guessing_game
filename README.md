# Guessing_game

This program is a simple two-player logical guessing game.
The game is played on a 4Ã—8 grid, and involves one player,
the searcher trying to find the locations of three battleships hidden by 
the other player, the hider. The searcher continues to guess until 
they find all the hidden ships. A guess consists of three different locations,
and the game continues until the exact locations of the three hidden ships are
guessed in a single guess. After each guess, the hider responds with 
three numbers, which represent the game feedback.
